# Responsive Design Guide

This project implements clean, minimalist responsive design using modern techniques.

## Breakpoints
The design uses TailwindCSS breakpoints consistently:
- `sm`: 640px and up
- `md`: 768px and up
- `lg`: 1024px and up
- `xl`: 1280px and up
- `2xl`: 1536px and up

## Mobile-First Approach
- The portfolio follows a mobile-first philosophy
- Layouts begin simple on mobile and expand on larger screens
- Content remains focused and accessible across all screen sizes

## Key Responsive Components
- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](mdc:src/components/Navbar.tsx) - Transforms to mobile menu on smaller screens
- [src/components/Hero/index.tsx](mdc:src/components/Hero/index.tsx) - Adjusts layout and typography responsively
- [src/components/Footer.tsx](mdc:src/components/Footer.tsx) - Adapts grid layout for different devices

## Responsive Implementation Techniques
- Fluid typography using relative units
- Minimal breakpoint-specific styles for cleaner code
- Strategic use of grid and flexbox layouts
- Appropriate spacing and whitespace adjustments

```tsx
// Example responsive pattern:
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 md:gap-6">
  {/* Content that adapts to grid layout */}
</div>
```

## Visual Elements
- Clean typography that scales appropriately
- Images and decorative elements that resize proportionally
- Subtle animations that work across device capabilities
- CSS variables for consistent spacing ([src/app/globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css))

## Responsive Design Principles
1. Maintain content hierarchy regardless of screen size
2. Preserve white space for readability
3. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile
4. Optimize performance across all devices
