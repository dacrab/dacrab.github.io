# Responsive Design Guide

This project implements responsive design using the following patterns and tools.

## Breakpoints
Use TailwindCSS breakpoints consistently throughout the application:
- `sm`: 640px and up
- `md`: 768px and up
- `lg`: 1024px and up
- `xl`: 1280px and up
- `2xl`: 1536px and up

## Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile layouts and add complexity for larger screens
- Use the [src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts](mdc:src/hooks/useIsMobile.ts) hook for client-side responsive logic

## Responsive Components
Components should adapt to different screen sizes using:
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:flex-row`)
- Container queries where appropriate

```tsx
// Example responsive class usage:
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

## Images and Media
- Use Next.js Image component with appropriate responsive options
- Ensure images have proper alt text for accessibility
- Consider loading different image sizes based on viewport

## Text and Typography
- Use relative units (rem) for font sizes
- Adjust line heights and letter spacing for readability
- Use Tailwind's typography classes consistently
